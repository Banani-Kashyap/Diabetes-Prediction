# Diabetes Prediction:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for detecting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using the "Pima Indians Diabetes" dataset. 

# Dataset:

"Pima Indians Diabetes" Dataset 

# Source: 

UCI Machine Learning Repository 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes)

# Purpose:

This project aims to create a machine-learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain health-related features. Predicting diabetes early can help in early intervention and better healthcare management for individuals at risk. Through the application of machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, the project aims to accurately classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic based on relevant medical and demographic features. The ultimate goal is to create a robust and reliable predictive tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early identification and intervention for individuals at risk of diabetes, thus potentially improving their health outcomes and quality of life.

# Technologies Used:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Dependencies:
To run this project, the following dependencies need to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Data:

The dataset used for this project can be found in the "diabetes.csv" file in the "data" directory. It contains various health-related features and a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

# Set-up Instructions:

- git Repository:
 https://github.com/Banani-Kashyap/diabetes-prediction.git

- Navigate to the project directory

- Launch Jupyter Notebook to run the project

- Open the "Diabetes_Prediction_BK.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook file to view the project code and execute it.

# How to Run:
Open the Jupyter Notebook "Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb."

Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and make predictions.

You can also modify the model parameters, try different algorithms, and experiment with feature selection to improve the prediction accuracy.

Execute each code cell in the notebook to run the project and observe the results.

# Testing:

To test the accuracy of the diabetes prediction model, I used various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are included in the Jupyter Notebook and can be calculated after training the model.
